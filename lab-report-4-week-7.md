# Lab Report 4
## Part 1 - Vim Tasks
Chosen task was "`Changing the name of the start parameter and its uses to base`".

`:` `%` `s` `/` `s` `t` `a` `r` `t` `/` `b` `a` `s` `e` `/` `g` `:` `w` `q`

### Before typing the command, the search shows 4 instances of "start" within the code.

## Part 2 - Comparing direct VIM vs. indirect VSCode+SCP
Chosen task was "`rename the new test to testSearchCount2 and change the query string being tested to tax rather than taxation`". 

> It took `2:06` minutes to edit with VScode locally. <br>
> It took `1:05` minutes to edit with VIM on remote.

* Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
Even if the program were to run remotely, I would still prefer VScode because it allows me more functionality and I am more accustomed to it.
For minor edits, however, I'd rather prefer vim.

* What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
If the project involves lots of coding and planning, I would rather port the files locally and work on my own system. However, if the project involves few lines of codes or edits, I would rather have VIM open and work directly from there.
